### 1 Entity = 1 Table

All the information that describes a business entity should be included in `individual` table.

- e.g. Customer, Product, Employee, Sales, Return, Store, etc.

A right way to define a table is `expand` it's attributes.

- e.g. Product Table should have Name, Group, Category, Sub Category, etc.

So that we can create a `relationship` between two different Table ( Business Entities )

It creates a better `granularity` and help us to describe each attribute in more simple way.

### Normalization

- `Remove` the duplicated or redundant data.

- `Reduce` the size of the table.

- Having a seperate table for each Business entity.

### Denormalization

- Creating a `single` table with all Business entity and attributes included redundancy and duplicated data.

### Star Schema

- `Best` Schema for Power BI
