### Aggregation and Summarization

- In any company, `Millions` of Transaction Data with Thousands of Rows per day have been captured.
- From this type of large data, we can prepare a `Summary` table using `Aggregation` and represent summarize visual.
- Performance of visual will be faster if data is fetching from the summary table instead of Raw Data. 
- Will get more optimized reports for a better experience.
